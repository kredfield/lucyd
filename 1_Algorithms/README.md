# TO BE REMOVED: Reference from syllabus
We leave the detailed design of the project website to the team
due to the variety of projects. Sometimes a project will emphasize
interactive data visualizations of integrated data sources to
facilitate data exploration. In other cases, the emphasis of the
project is on machine learning, and will present the model in detail
and perhaps permit users to try the model out on their own data.
In all cases, the website demonstrates best efforts to make web
deliverable mission-driven, clear (in terms of communication),
clean, functional and well organized, and as a showcase for your
cumulative work. Ultimately, the web deliverable demonstrates
strong tactical and strategic thinking and implementation to lead
web site visitors and users to understand, appreciate, and engage
with your project and call-to-action.
