## What is lucyd?
lucyd is a music recommendation tool developed by four graduate students in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program.

## Why is it different?
lucyd seeks to demystify the typical "black box" music recommendation algorithm. When you log in to Spotify or Apple Music, you can only assume how these providers develop your weekly recommended playlist.

lucyd offers something different. Our algorithm focuses on you--how do you perceive a song, and how can that be used to find new ones?

## Down to the data science
Designing lucyd required several steps:
  * [**Algorithm:**](/1_Algorithms/) Outline framework and requirements of a music recommendation algorithm based upon user-determined "tags", rather than song and/or artist attributes.
  * [**Data Source(s):**](/2_Data Sources/) Identify potential data sources to "teach" the recommendation algorithm.
  * [**Visualizations:**](/3_Visualizations/) Develop visualizations that help the user understand the songs in their playlist, and the ones nearby.
