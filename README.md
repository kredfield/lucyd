## What is lucyd?
lucyd is a music recommendation tool developed by four graduate students in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program.

## Why is it different?
lucyd seeks to demystify the typical "black box" music recommendation algorithm. When you log in to Spotify or Apple Music, you can only assume how these providers develop your weekly recommended playlist.

lucyd offers something different. Our algorithm focuses on you--how do you perceive a song, and how can that be used to find new ones?

## Who is lucyd for?
lucyd is not for someone who just flips on the radio and rocks along to today's Top 40 hits. It is a tool for music "Savants and Enthusiasts"--the people whose favorite pastime is perusing music blogs or the depths of their streaming service. lucyd is for users who are willing to put in a little effort to find the next song to hit their "Most Played" list.

## Down to the data science
Designing lucyd required several steps:
  * [**Algorithms:**](/1_Algorithms/) Outline framework and requirements of a music recommendation algorithm based upon user-determined "tags", rather than song and/or artist attributes.
  * [**Data Source(s):**](/2_DataSources/) Identify potential data sources to "teach" the recommendation algorithm.
  * [**Visualizations:**](/3_Visualizations/) Develop visualizations that help the user understand the songs in their playlist, and the ones nearby.
