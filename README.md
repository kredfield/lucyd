## What is lucyd?
lucyd is a music recommendation tool developed by four graduate students in UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) program.

## Why is it different?
lucyd let's you ask for music recommendations using whichever terms you want. lucyd seeks to demystify the typical "black box" music recommendation algorithm by not only giving you the freedom to customize your recommended playlists, but by giving you interactive tools and visualizations so you learn about your music while you explore.

lucyd offers something different. Our algorithm focuses on you--how do you perceive a song, and how can that be used to find new ones?

## Who is lucyd for?
lucyd is a tool for people who are curious about music. If your favorite pasttime is perusing music blogs, clicking into the depths of your streaming service, or curating your own playlists, lucyd can provide you with more tools to navigate the worlds music.

## Down to the data science
Designing lucyd required several steps:
  * [**Algorithms:**](/1_Algorithms/) Outline framework and requirements of a music recommendation algorithm based upon user-determined "tags", rather than song and/or artist attributes.
  * [**Data Source(s):**](/2_DataSources/) Identify potential data sources to "teach" the recommendation algorithm.
  * [**Visualizations:**](/3_Visualizations/) Develop visualizations that help the user understand the songs in their playlist, and the ones nearby
  * [**Application Framework:**](/4_ApplicationFramework/) Combine all of these elements into a live web application that allows the user to influence and learn from the songs recommended by lucyd.

Mike is a Chicago-based derivatives trader who enjoys live music and his mini Bernedoodle, Hugo. At a young age he developed an internal algorithm to identify the most efficient checkout line at any given supermarket; rumor has it he has never been wrong. He tried to replicate some of this magic in the development of lucyd, where he focused on algorithmic design and user interactivity.\
